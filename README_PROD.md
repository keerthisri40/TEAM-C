# Govind - Secure Voice-First Communication Assistant

This repository contains the production-grade implementation of **Govind**, a voice-first assistant designed for secure communication via Telegram and Gemini AI.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a modern **Serverless Service-Service** architecture optimized for Vercel.

User → Frontend (React + Vite) → Vercel Serverless (API v1) → Services → External Providers (Gemini/Telegram)

### Key Architectural Layers:
- **Frontend**: Clean React-TS UI with a unified API client.
- **API v1**: Versioned route handlers with centralized middleware.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic decoupled from HTTP transport.
- **Security Layer**: Firebase Admin integration, RBAC-ready auth, and Webhook idempotency.

## 🛡️ Security Design (Audit-Ready)

1. **Zero Client-Side Secrets**: All third-party API keys (Gemini, Telegram) are stored as private environment variables on Vercel. No keys are exposed to the browser.
2. **Standardized Middleware**: All `/api/v1` routes are protected by a middleware that verifies Firebase Auth ID tokens and attaches request-ids for traceability.
3. **Webhook Idempotency**: Incoming Telegram updates are tracked via `update_id` in Firestore to prevent duplicate processing.
4. **Prompt Guardrails**: AI inputs are sanitized, and mandatory system-level guardrails are enforced on the backend to prevent prompt injection.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Fair usage is enforced per User UID and Endpoint using a leaking-bucket strategy.
